## Introduction
Inspired by the article ["10 OOP Design Principles Every Programmer Should Know"](https://hackernoon.com/10-oop-design-principles-every-programmer-should-know-f187436caf65)
which was written by [@javinpaul](https://hackernoon.com/@javinpaul), I built this project to implement the top Object Oriented Design principles in Java.
The implementation is about Stock Price Quote which sounds like interesting and practical.
